# the file structure is not completely formalized,
# but it should be intuitive from repetition in existing documents

# the integration with an environment such as an OS, a file system
# or a Git repository are key to the project evolution
# e.g a functor from git structure to build system
# an assumption was necessary for the sake of organization

# the use of ~ is the key to the language conciseness
# ~ allows referring to a term that's not yet named and
# ~ can be represented in minimal ways in YAML
