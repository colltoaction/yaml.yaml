# the file structure is not yet formalized,
# but it should be intuitive from repetition in existing documents

# the integration with an environment such as an OS, a file system
# or a Git repository are key to the project evolution
# e.g a functor from git structure to build system

# should be considered thoroughly
# an assumption was necessary for the sake of organization

# it's worth mentioning at this point that
# this code is compiling only in my head
# and I plan to write an interpreter soon

# public source code lives at https://github.com/colltoaction/yaml.yaml
